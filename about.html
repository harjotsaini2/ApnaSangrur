            <h1 class="mb-4">History of <span
                    class="text-primary">Sangrur</span></h1>
            <p class="mb-4">The district of Sangrur was formed in 1948.
                The name of the district from its headquarters, Sangrur,
                said to be have founded by one Sanghu, a Jat, about 400
                years back. The Sangrur District as of today comprises
                parts of a few erstwhile distinct administrative units,
                the Philkian States if Jind, Nabha and Patiala: the
                Mohammadan State of Malerkotla; and some parts of then
                district of Ludhiana. It is interesting to note that
                Sangrur itself was earlier a part of Nabha State.
                History of the district is, therefore, complicated,
                although it is traceable through its various components.
                In brief, history of the district is given as under.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The excavations carried out by the
                Archeological Department, Punjab, at the various places
                of Malerkotla Tehsil of Sangrur District, give
                sufficient proof that the district is quite rich in
                ancient history. From the close of scrutiny of the
                available data, the researchers have traced the ancient
                history of the district from the pre-harappan period.
                Almost the whole of the excavated places fall in
                Malerkotla Tehsil of the Sangrur Deistrict. The
                important sites so far excavated in the Malerkotla
                Tehsil are as under
                <br>
                Rohira <br>
                Mahorana <br>
                Bhudan <br>
                Bahwa <br>
                Bhasaur <br>
                Dhingri <br>
                Jandali <br>
                Malaud Rorian (Theh Loharan) <br>
                Mohammadpur <br>
                It lies about 6 Km From Mandi Ahmadgarh and about 13 km
                from Malerkotla. It is situated along the line of
                depression which follows the ancient course of river
                Saituj. It is worthwhile to mention here that it was
                near Rohira that thousanids of Sikhs were massacred by
                Ahmad Shah Abdali in a great holocaust known as Wada
                Ghallugghara, in 1762. Recently, an exiting discovery of
                a pre-Harappan settlement – a pre-cursor of ‘the Indus
                Valley of Harappan civilisation has bcen made at an
                ancient mound at Ruhira which has now emerged as tJie
                second important pre-Harappan site in. India. Kalibaugan
                in the Sriganganagar area of Rajasthan was the first
                site to reveal an important pre-Harappan settlement
                after 10 years of continuous excavation, Experts believe
                that from the Kalibangan area, pre-Harappan people
                started moving in the northern or northern -eastern
                direction along some of the streams which have now dried
                up. The ancient water courses are marked by ranges of
                sand dunes. The different stages of this movement
                towards the Satluj have remained uninvestigated so far.
               <br>
                The mound is 10 metres above the surrounding fields,
                Originally it cuveredl an area of more than 30 acres.
                However, onJy 15 acres of it is now left, the rest
                having been brought under cultivation. Out of this, an
                area of 900 sq. meters has been taken up for excavation.
                <br>
                The earliest settlement at the site is believed to have
                begun around 2,300 B.C Attracted by the fertile soil and
                availability of water, people from Sind and Baluchistan
                started moving and following the path of the Satluj or
                the Ghagger settled at Rohira.
                <br>
                They started living in thatched huts on the virgin soil,
                Before long they started building houses of sub-dried
                bricks. The houses were well laid out and were fairly
                spacious.
                  <br>
                A large number of beads of terra-cotta, carnelian agate,
                bangle pieces of terra-cotta and bone styluses
                discovered there testify to the prosperity of the region
                and its trade relations with distant lands.
                <br>
                This period is designated as pre-Harappan. The finds at
                this place are comparable to those of
                Kalibangan(Rajasthan). Banawali (Bhiwani District) Balu
                (Jind District) and Kot Diji and Amri in Pakistan
                <br>
                By about 2,000 B.C, a new set of people is believed to
                have settled at the site.. Their pottery was more Surdy
                and their equipment superior. There is no evidence of
                any upheaval
                <br>
                A citadel which possibly ran all-round the residential
                complex was constructed to guard against invaders
<br>
                Houses of bead makers with a large number of finished
                and unfinished beads and two copper chisels have been
                recovered. These finds point to the advanced technology
                of the Copper-Bronze age. Certain finds of gold beads,
                attest to the prosperity of the people. They used fine,
                well baked pots, jars and troughs. Clay figurines of
                bull, terra-cotta. and idli-shaped cakes have been found
                in abundance. A well made of hated bricks has also been
                discovered. At least five phases of house construction
                have been found.
<br>
                The most notable find is a terra-cotta seal depicting a
                mythological scene of ritual killing.The site was
                possibly desires by 1700 B.C and the newcomers ‘Bara
                foJks1 (named after Bara site near Ropar), occupied it.
                The use; of culture pots, vessels and water jars gave a
                distinctive character to this culture. The use of com
                bins is a typical feature of this area.
<br>
                The new people wluo made Rohira their abode from 1100 to
                500 B.C. used the painted grey ware. They were- followed
                by people who used black ware (600 to 200 B.C.). Even
                though thcir regular habitation has not been found in
                the area under excavation, surface explorations and pits
                dug in the area indicate their presence at the site.
<br>
                There is evident of Sunga-Kushan porttery. The area around the east has structures typical of Kushan bricks
                with finger marks. Some tcrra-cotta figurines including
                one of mother goddess, a few small coins of
                Indo-Pcrthian King Gondo Pharnese (first century A.D.)
                arid Iate Kusban coins have also been discovered, Since
                thc area of Sangrur lies in close proximity to the must
                known battlefield of Kurukshetra of epic times, there is
                the least doubt of its having been under the influence
                of vedic culture it must have been a settlement of the
                Aryans. The Rigwedaa is the earliest literary record of
                the socio-cultural development and affords us the First
                glimpse of the life of its people. The most important
                god of the Vedic period indra. A thorough analysis of
                the character of various Vedic gods reflects the heroic
                character of the Aryan Society. The heroic society of
                the Vedic period was tribal in character. The ideal of
                the hero is laid down in the Mahabharta: ‘:Fame is all
                that one should acquire here. That fame can be acquired
                by battle and by no other means.” The ashramas of
                teachers and sages in forests were their military
                academies humming and throbbing with the activities of
                young athletes and cadets.
<br>
                Further, the Mahabharata contains profuse and useful
                information on various aspects of the political and
                socio-culture life of the land. From the scrutiny ofihe
                Mahabharta, it is presumed that Yaudheyas, a martial
                tribe occupied the present area of Sangrur along with
                the allied tarritories in the proximity of Kurukshetra..
                Yaudheyas were a gena community who were famous for
                their valour. Their coins have been found mostly in tlhe
                eastern Punjab and in the region between the Satluj and
                Yamuna.
<br>
                The area of present Sangrur Distrct alongwith adjoining
                areas came under the Maurya Dyansty in B.C. 322. It was
                Chandragupta Maurya who established Maurya Dynasty After
                overthrowing the Nandas.
<br>
                This area also enjoyed the blessings of the Gupta
                administration from the beginning of the 4th Century to
                the end of the 6th Century, Because of the efficient
                administration, Gupta era haa been known as the Golden
                age of Hindu period Chandragupta Vikramditya was the
                most famous king of the Gupta Dynasty.
<br>
                In the beginning of the 7th Century, Prabhakara Vardhana
                ruled over this area whose capital was at Thenesar. not
                far from the present area of Sangrur District, His
                brother Harsha Vardhana who rcduced anarchy to order in
                Northern India, and reigned for forty-one years, from AD
                606-47. However, later on, Harsha Vardhana shifted his
                capital From Thanesar to Kanauj, because of the
                extension of the territory of the empire.
<br>
                Early in the 8th Century, Thanesar ceased to exist and
                another line of kings, Tomar Rajputs, established itself
                in the South East Punjab. After about a century, the
                Tomars were supplanted by the Chauhans of Ajmer.
